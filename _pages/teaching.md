# Teaching

Past students are always encouraged to come back to visit at my Office: ENR2-S390BB.

## Graduate Teaching Assistant 
### University of Arizona
As a GTA at the University of Arizona, I individually taught three classes: Math 107 (Exploring and Understanding Data), Math 112 (College Algebra Concepts and Applications) and Math 186J (College Algebra Supplemental Instruction Seminar) and previously assisted professors for two semesters of Math 107. As the primary instructor, I created course lectures and exams, graded, and hosted office hours for my approximately 30 students a course. 

## Undergraduate Teaching Assistant 
### Lycoming College 
As a UTA at Lycoming College, I assisted professors with grading and classroom management in multiple mathematics and computer science courses. Additionally, I was a tutor in the Mathematics Lab.
