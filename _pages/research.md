## 1) Automated Segmentation of Meltpools in 3D Printed Artifacts 
We present a new hybrid approach for large-scale segmentation and spatially- resolved analysis of melt pools in complex 3D printed parts and qualification artifacts. Our hybrid segmentation approach includes human-in-the-loop image processing of a few representative optical images of melt pools that are then used for training machine learning models for automated segmentation of melt pool boundaries in large parts. Our approach specifically targets minimizing the need for manual annotation. Considering imperfect segmentation and errors unavoidable with most algorithms, we further propose chord length distribution (CLD) as a statistical metric of melt pool size relatively insensitive to boundary segmentation errors. We first show and validate our new protocol on optical images of melt pools in a simple 3D printed plate sample (IN718 alloy) as well as selected regions of a qualification artifact (AlSi10Mg alloy). We then demonstrate the application of our approach on a large-area cross section of the entire artifact.
