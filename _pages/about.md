Hi! Welcome to my page. I'm currently a fourth year PhD student in the Applied Mathematics Program and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Arizona. My research falls at the intersection of applied mathematics and materals science. Iâ€™m particularly focused on integrating machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accelerate materials design, with a long-term goal of contributing to the development of sustainable materials for a cleaner, greener future.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, camping, hiking, and playing soccer. Most importantly, I love spending time I spend with my dog, Jumba.
