* I'm a PhD student in the Applied Mathematics Program at the University of Arizona. My research broadly focuses on machine learning applications in materials science. Currently, my research is focused on accelerating the current CALPHAD framework by extracting thermodynamic data from the literature. I work in the research group led by Dr. Marat Latypov, where one of our goals is to accelerate the CALPHAD framework through the use of Natural Language Processing and Large Vision - Language Models. 

In the past, I have worked on projects applying machine learning to meltpool segmentation and signal processing.
