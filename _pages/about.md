Hi! Welcome to my page. &#128515 I'm a fourth year PhD student in the Applied Mathematics Program at the University of Arizona. My research falls at the intersection of applied mathematics and materals science. Specifically, my research focuses on utilizing computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accelerate the materials design process.
